abstract: "As knowledge of and familiarity with science becomes an increasingly important\
  \ aspect of contemporary life and citizenship, efforts have been made to make the\
  \ science curriculum a ``lived'' curriculum (Hurd, 2000), one that reaches out to\
  \ the lives, communities, and experiences of students. In this research around a\
  \ high school urban ecology curriculum, we advance the idea that a focus on meaning,\
  \ as the keystone for identity development, can help reach the goal of a lived science\
  \ curriculum. Drawing upon social practice theory (Holland & Lave, 2001, 2009) and\
  \ figured worlds (Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, & Cain, 1998; Urietta, 2007), we\
  \ present a way to conceptualize the meanings which emerge. We find through interviews\
  \ with the adult participants (two curriculum developers and a classroom teacher)\
  \ and students that meaning is described using three layers: meaning in person,\
  \ meaning in intent, and meaning in practice. There are points of continuity and\
  \ discontinuity of these meanings attributed to the curriculum by the adult participants.\
  \ We further present data through the analysis of classroom video and artifacts\
  \ created by students during an activity designed to elicit the meanings that students\
  \ attribute to the curriculum. We discuss these findings and the possibilities for\
  \ curriculum to provide opportunities for intersecting figured worlds which provide\
  \ a focus on meaning and opportunities for agency in and with science. © 2013 Wiley\
