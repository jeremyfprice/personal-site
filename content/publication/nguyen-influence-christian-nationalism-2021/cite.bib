 abstract = {Public school educators must navigate very complex intersections of the First Amendment's Establishment, Free Exercise, and Free Speech clauses. The 6th Circuit's ruling in Meriwether vs. Hartop created a slippery slope that could create a hostile learning environment and be discriminatory speech while trying to balance public-school educators' sincerely held religious beliefs.
