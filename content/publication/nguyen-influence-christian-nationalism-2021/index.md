abstract: Public school educators must navigate very complex intersections of the
  First Amendment's Establishment, Free Exercise, and Free Speech clauses. The 6th
  Circuit's ruling in Meriwether vs. Hartop created a slippery slope that could create
  a hostile learning environment and be discriminatory speech while trying to balance
  public-school educators' sincerely held religious beliefs. This article examines
  the Meriwether case and court ruling while providing a background of U.S. Christian
  nationalism and its implications in American public education.
