abstract: The authors have worked to meet the demands of the 21st century by using
  the Urban EcoLab, an urban ecology curriculum based on the National Science Education
  Standards. This curriculum emphasizes the local and community-based nature of science
  and is freely available for teachers to view, download, and use. As part of the
  curriculum the authors developed two frameworks that teachers can use to help meet
  the challenges of the 21st century. (Contains 4 figures.)
