This course investigates innovations, emerging technologies, and technology's role in education
reform. Students will collaborate to search out, evaluate, and synthesize research studies and
verifiable information about promising educational technologies.

The course as a whole is guided by the overarching essential question:

`What are the critical issues that intersect with technology and education, and how
do we approach these issues in our classrooms, schools, and communities?`

Exploring this question prepares students to engage with the current state of educational technology in
society and in the classroom more deeply. Students are introduced to four critical issues and
explore each issue through a spiral process of building new knowledge and deepening understandings
moving from understanding to analyzing to transforming. Each module is further guided by an
essential question and a learning goal with a set of readings and a culminating performance that
challenges you to engage in transforming the issue through educational technology.
