location: Online

summary: A toolkit for understanding, recognizing, and responding to antisemitism in public school meetings.
abstract: "As public school meetings become more heated and contentious along a range of different issues, from disagreements on matters of protecting public health, to maintaining historical accuracy in the curriculum, the incidence of antisemitic statements, connections with tropes, and the enactment of behaviors have risen alongside these increasingly heated events. This Virtual Roundtable provides an overview of these antisemitic incidents when they occur, connecting them with broader socio-historical contexts, and providing strategies for dealing with them. This Roundtable was facilitated on behalf of the Midwest & Plains Equity Center."
