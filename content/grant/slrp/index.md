Students from Black and Latinx (Dorn et al., 2020; Kurtz, 2020) and low-income (Chetty et al., 2020; Horowitz, 2020) families and communities and students with disabilities (DeMatthews, 2020; Levesque, 2020) are experiencing the brunt of inequitable experiences due to the pandemic. We will start with these already marginalized students and utilize a multiple data point approach: academic performance (GPA and NWEA), teacher reports on SEL needs, and caregiver assessment of how they perceive their children’s academic success and desire on the caregiver’s part for more supports.

Our full in-person approach is grounded in Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (Ladson-Billings, 1995) and Universal Design for Learning (Rose & Meyer, 2000). Our approach to recovery learning bridge and facilitate relationships between educators, families, and caregivers that honors and is inclusive and equitable for all learners (Fritzgerald, 2020) promoting important self-directed gains in Learning. Our current work funded by a GEER grant has provided us with extensive experience and expertise in these areas, allowing us to quickly pivot and work with the most disadvantaged students, their families, and their communities. The neighborhood stakeholders will provide an extended network for recovery.
