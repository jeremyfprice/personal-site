To meet the challenge of remote learning in context and community, grounded in the principles of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP; Ladson-Billings, 1995) and Universal Design for Learning (UDL; Hitchcock, Meyer, Rose, & Jackson, 2002; Rose & Meyer, 2002), the Indiana University School of Education-Indianapolis at IUPUI proposes the Digital Education Hub (DEH) for Rigorous Remote Learning with Communities. The DEH supports educator capacity as described in Objective 3 and Component 2 through online materials for teachers, administrators and families and caregivers to improve remote learning.

We will provide a variety of learning experiences to support educators, families, and communities as they navigate the terrain of remote learning. Consistent inclusion of students with special needs and those who are often most marginalized will be a mandatory focus of all materials, with attention on curating and creating content that is optimized for the technologies that communities use on a regular basis, such as mobile devices. Certain materials will intentionally integrate families’ knowledge with digital annotations.
